Use CIFAR10_sample.py and MNIST_sample.py to obtain the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets.

ResNet50.py and DenseNet121.py are the two networks, which are called to be trained by CIFAR10_ResNet50.py or CIFAR10_DenseNet121.py or MNIST_ResNet50.py or MNIST_DenseNet121.py

Then for the two benchmark datasets, take CIFAR10 and DenseNet121 for example. Run CIFAR10_DenseNet121_IF_setupX.py for Setup X in my paper, where X=1,2,3,4.
To summarize the results, use the R code CIFAR10_DenseNet121_IF_setupX_result.R first, then use the python code CIFAR10_DenseNet121_IF_setupX_result.py to get the plots.
